Meets Specifications

Core Data

- The app uses a managed object model created in the Xcode Model Editor. A .xcdatamodeld model file is present.
    - Concurrency tested and it is thread-safe. Well done!
- The object model contains both Pin and Photo entities.
- The object model contains a one-to-many relationship between the Pin and Photo entities, with an appropriate inverse.

Travel Locations Map View

- The app contain a map view that allows users to drop pins with a touch and hold gesture.
- When a pin is tapped, the app transitions to the photo album associated with the pin location.
- When pins are dropped on the map, the pins are persisted as Pin instances in Core Data and the context is saved.

Photo Album View

- When a Photo Album View is opened for a pin that does not yet have any photos, it initiates a download from Flickr.
- The code for downloading photos is in its own class, separate from the PhotoAlbumViewController.
- Images display as they are downloaded. They are shown with placeholders in a collection view while they download, and displayed as soon as possible.
- The specifics of storing an image is left to Core Data by activating the “Allows External Storage” option.
- Once all images have been downloaded, the user can remove photos from the album by tapping the image in the collection view. Tapping the image removes it from the photo album, the booth in the collection view, and Core Data.
- The Photo Album view has a button that initiates the download of a new album, replacing the images in the photo album with a new set from Flickr.
- If the Photo Album view is opened for a pin that previously had photos assigned, they are immediately displayed. No new download is needed.

Comments:

PhotoAlbumViewController.swift

ln 45 - "Awesome! Saved images are displayed without making another server call."

ln 146 - "Awesome! The images are displayed as soon as they are downloaded."

ln 255 - Suggestion: "I strongly suggest that you save the context after fetching new images. Any changes before the autosaving are called will be lost if users quit the app."

ln 274 - "Awesome! Great job removing the photos from the view and the Core Data."

MapViewController.swift

ln 84 - Suggestion: "I believe it is better to use .began instead of .ended. That way users will be able to see the pin once the press starts."

FlickrClient.swift

ln 25 - "Awesome! Good job changing the page from which the app downloads."
